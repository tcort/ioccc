# Past IOCCC Submissions

This repository contains my past submissions to the International
Obfuscated C Coding Contest.

- IOCCC 28
 - Text to Morse - renders text into International Morse Code and writes the output to a Waveform Audio File (`.wav` file).
- IOCCC 27
 - Find and Replace - lots of goofy comments, strange indentation, misleading variable names, and a single setjmp and longjmp for flow control.
 - Spell - a spell checker consisting of 5 subprograms (`makewords`, `lowercase`, `sort`, `uniq`, `mismatch`) demonstrated in a Bell Labs video from 1982.
 - Template - a templating system which calls shell commands (e.g. `Hello ${logname}, and welcome to ${hostname}!`).
